DOMAIN:DATA SCIENCE

DURATION:4 WEEKS

MENTOR:NEELA SANTOSH

#DESCRIPTION
üìå Project Overview:
The goal of this deep learning internship task is to implement a fully functional deep learning model for either image classification or natural language processing (NLP) using TensorFlow or PyTorch. The project must be developed in Visual Studio Code (VS Code) and should include visualizations of results to showcase model performance. This task not only develops your practical skills in AI/ML but also enhances your ability to work with frameworks and tools commonly used in real-world industry scenarios.

üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies Required:
To successfully complete this task, the following tools and environments are required:

‚úÖ 1. Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
A powerful, lightweight source-code editor.

Extensions such as Python, Jupyter Notebooks, and Pylance are essential.

‚úÖ 2. Python (Version 3.7 or above)
Required to build and run the deep learning model.

Most deep learning libraries are Python-based.

‚úÖ 3. TensorFlow or PyTorch
These are the two most widely-used deep learning frameworks.

TensorFlow (by Google) or PyTorch (by Facebook) can be used depending on familiarity.

üìä Model Options:
You can choose either:

Option 1: Image Classification (e.g., CIFAR-10, MNIST)
Load dataset (use tf.keras.datasets or torchvision.datasets)

Build CNN model

Train, test, and validate

Visualize accuracy/loss graphs

Show prediction results

Option 2: Natural Language Processing
Example: Sentiment analysis using IMDB dataset

Use RNN/LSTM models

Tokenization using Tokenizer (TensorFlow) or TorchText

Visualize word distribution, confusion matrix

üìà Visualizations:
You must include:

Training & validation loss/accuracy over epochs (using matplotlib)

Sample predictions with actual vs predicted labels

Confusion matrix

‚úÖ Deliverables:
A functional .py or .ipynb file with your model code.

Screenshots or embedded plots showing model performance.

A README.md file explaining:

What the project does

How to run it

Dataset used

Model architecture

üìù Final Tips:
Prefer using GPU (Google Colab or install CUDA locally if needed).

Comment your code clearly.

Use model.save() or torch.save() to save your model.
